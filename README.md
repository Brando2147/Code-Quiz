# Code-Quiz

## Description 

For this assignment I built a simple code quiz.It is timed at 60 seconds. This should allow you to choose from multiple choice answers. When you choose a wrong answer you will be deducted 10 seconds on the clock. When you finish the quiz you can save your initials to the scoreboard.
